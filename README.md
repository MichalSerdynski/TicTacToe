When you start the game, you will see an empty Tic Tac Toe board. The board is represented by a grid of numbers, as shown below:

 ```
 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
 ```

To place your mark on the board, simply enter the number corresponding to the position where you want to play. For example, if you want to place your mark in the top-right corner, enter the number 3.

The game will alternate between X and O players, with X going first. The game will continue until either a player wins or the board is full and the game is a draw.
